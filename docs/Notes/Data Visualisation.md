Learning from Lombardi
https://medium.com/@ben_fry/learning-from-lombardi-a28032a7eb5
> In **Lombardi**’s case, even his early scribbles on a project are more informative, because they show a fundamentally human thought process, of trying to draw the story out of the mass of data he had collected. This is the opposite of many computational approaches that begin with a mass of data, followed by an often failed attempt to simplify it.

Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display
http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html
> These tools carry with them assumptions of knowledge as observer-independent and certain, rather than observer co-dependent and interpretative. This paper argues that we need a humanities approach to the graphical expression of interpretation. To begin, the concept of _data_ as a given has to be rethought through a humanistic lens and characterized as _capta_, taken and constructed. Next, the forms for graphical expression of capta need to be more nuanced to show ambiguity and complexity.
