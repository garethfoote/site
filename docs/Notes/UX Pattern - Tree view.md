## Examples
[MDN Web Docs - ARIA: tree role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/tree_role) 
> An example of a `tree` is a file system selection user interface: a tree view displaying folders and files. Folder items can be expanded to reveal the contents of the folder — which may be files, folders, or both — and collapsed, hiding its contents.


[Deque University - Tree View example](https://dequeuniversity.com/library/aria/tree-view)
> Tree view is a hierarchical structure with parent and child nodes that can expand and collapse. Tree views on the web are not common, but they do exist, often to represent a file system or other similar structure of folders and files.

> Each of the above has a CodePen example
 
[ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG) - Navigation Treeview example](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/example-index/treeview/treeview-navigation)
Often treeviews are used for complex nested navigation but this is not recommended
> [!danger]
> The above use of a treeview is an anti-pattern. Not the best accessibilty pattern to use. 
> "A pattern more suited for typical site navigation with expandable groups of links is the [disclosure pattern.](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/)"
